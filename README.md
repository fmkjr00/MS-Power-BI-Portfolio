- Created a measure to calculate the sum of reimbursed amount in INR.

- Used the calculate function and check the total reimbursed amount for Project_B

- Created a measure to check the count of declined requests.

- Created a slicer visual for the Project and employee
  
- Created a bar chart for employees and reimbursement amount.

- Created a pie chart for Project vs reimbursement amount
